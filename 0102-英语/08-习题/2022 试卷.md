It is estimated // *that* there are now more smartphones <u>   than   </u> people {on the planet^[n.星球]}. The manufacture^[n.生产] and disposal^[n.处理] of phones are clearly environmental <u>  concerns  </u>. The US {<u>  which  </u> has more than a quarter of a billion phones} ready to be recycled, and an extra 11 million are <u>  added  </u> to this figure every month. It is reported //<u>   </u>*that*<u>   </u> less than 20% of these phones end up actually being recycled.
The metals {that are used in the <u>  production  </u> of smartphones} are precious^[adj.珍贵的] resources. Some <u>  valuable  </u> metals are often mined in extremely^[adv.及其] poor working conditions. If phones are not recycled, more and more of these metals <u>  need  </u> to be mined to keep up with the demand for new models. And when phones are buried under the ground, harmful elements leak^[v.渗入] into the <u>  soil  </u>, polluting groundwater. To reduce the negative effect of this problem, we should think <u>  carefully  </u> about how to recycle our old phones.
